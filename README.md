# React Native FlatList Dynamic Styling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using dynamic styling within React Native's FlatList component. The bug manifests as visual glitches or unexpected rendering behavior when styles depend on data that changes between renders.

## Bug Description

The `FlatList` component fails to update correctly when styles are dynamically applied based on item data. This often occurs when the style object is not immutable or when references within the style object change unexpectedly. This can cause flickering, incorrect styling, or even crashes.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app on an Android or iOS emulator/device.
4. Observe the erratic behavior of the FlatList items.

## Solution

The provided solution demonstrates how to avoid this bug by using techniques such as creating immutable style objects or using memoization to prevent unnecessary style recalculations.  The solution involves creating memoized style functions and ensuring data immutability.
