This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and attempting to render items that contain dynamic styles based on their data.  The issue arises when the style object is improperly constructed or contains references that change unexpectedly between renders, causing the component to re-render unnecessarily or fail to update correctly. This can lead to visual glitches or performance issues.
